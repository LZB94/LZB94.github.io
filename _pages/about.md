![Europe’s electricity generation from wind blown off course](/images/wind.jpg){: .align-right width="400px"}

👨🏻‍💻 I'm a PhD student working on the near-surface wind speed change at Regional Climate Group [(RCG)](http://rcg.gvc.gu.se/) in University Gothenburg, supervised by Prof [Deliang Chen](http://rcg.gvc.gu.se/dc/).   

🔬 My research interests are wind speed change and wind energy, my work aims to find the potential causes to changes in wind speed and wind extreme events, using a combination of observationas, reanalysis and simulation models.

📽️ Collaborations are welcome.

# Selected Experience


## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal. \
(🤫 Recently, I have submitted a second one.)

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I work on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.

![The deep-time evolutions of aridity and dryland](/images/arid.jpg) 


👨🏻‍💻 I'm a PhD student working on the climate change in Peking University, supervised by Prof [Yongyun Hu](https://faculty.pku.edu.cn/yyhu/zh_CN/index.htm/).   

🔬 My research interests include paleoclimate (deep-time, last millennium), present and future climate (near-surface wind speed, monsoon, atmospheric teleconnection).

📽️ International cooperation is always welcomed!
